# Autogen for Multimodal (PDF) RAG
- For RAG indexing, mainly followed this guide: https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/memory.html#rag-agent-putting-it-all-together
- used pymupdf (and pymupdf4llm) as my PDF reader: https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rag.html#rag-outputting-as-md
- The backend and frontend parts were taken from AI Agentic Frameworks from here: https://github.com/M-H-Amini/YouTube/tree/f25c7480ac95075b8ca6f73be734a465a97ca2c0/Agentic. Combines parts from the tutorials: 4_TalkWithYourDataset and 6_Arxiv. 
- A few parts were also taken from my own GitHub: https://github.com/amzarmuzani95/ai-agents-mha
